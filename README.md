## Guess-the-Number Game
This Windows 10 app is a simple number-guessing game where the user is asked to guess a number between 1 and 20, inclusive.
The user has 5 attempts to either guess the correct value, or loses the game. Since the correct value is randomly generated, 
the answer is almost always different each round of the game. 

## How to Run 

Because the app is unpublished, it is best to import it to Visual Studio and run it directly from the IDE.
